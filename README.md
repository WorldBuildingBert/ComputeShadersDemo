This is a demo for GODOT 4.4 showcasing the usecases for a compute shader to store environment information in a texture used only on the GPU.
The demo includes 3 scenes that can each be run on their own
  1. A simple painting scene in 2d
  2. A "character" walking through interactive snow
  3. A simple shooter with the focus on the bullet holes
Feel free to use this code however you like
